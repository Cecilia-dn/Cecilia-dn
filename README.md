## About Me
 My journey started with curiosity and has grown into a strong foundation in Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python. Here youâ€™ll find dashboards, case studies, and the occasional SQL query that show how data isnâ€™t just numbers itâ€™s late shipments, loyal customers, or products nobodyâ€™s buying. I use my skills to dig into those stories and share them here in a way thatâ€™s simple and visual.

  
  ðŸ’¡ Data tells storiesâœ¨ and Iâ€™m here to uncover them.
